vimrc-and-colorscheme
=====================

This is the .vimrc and colorscheme that I like to use. Do with it what you will.

To install, move the ".vimrc" file to your home directory (back up yours if necessary!) and
move the "CaseyCustom.vim" file to the ~/.vim/colors/ directory.

NOTE: You may need to create the "~/.vim/colors/" direcotry if it doesn't exist; just use:
"mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors/"
