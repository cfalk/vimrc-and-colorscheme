vimrc-and-colorscheme
=====================

This is the Vim configuration that I like to use. Do with it what you will.

**To install on Ubuntu**, move the `.vimrc` file to `~/` (your home directory) *(back up yours if necessary!)* and move the `CaseyCustom.vim` file to the `~/.vim/colors/` directory.

Note that you may need to create the `~/.vim/colors/` directory if it doesn't exist; just use: `mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors/`
